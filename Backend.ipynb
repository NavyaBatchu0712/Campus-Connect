Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).  \\nTerminal master’s degree: a master’s degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M.

Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes.

CSC 502C is a continuation of CSC 502 and also requires being enrolled in CSC 502. It is offered in the Fall and Spring terms and can be repeated for credit. Additionally, students must also complete an additional 3-unit upper-division CSC course that fulfills major requirements, excluding CSC 192-195, 198, and 199.
